# Spotify-Dataset-Analysis1

We use this SQL command chain to analyse spotify dataset from Kaggle. 
By this project, I will be answering the following questions:

Which artist has the most songs in the top streamed list of 2023?
What is the average number of streams for songs released in each month of 2023?
Are songs with higher danceability percentages generally more popular (i.e. have more streams)?
What percentage of songs in the 'Top Spotify Songs 2023' were actually released in 2023?
